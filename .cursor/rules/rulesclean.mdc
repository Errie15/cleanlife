# CleanLife Project Rules

🧠 Agent Development Rules
🤖 Start every reply with a robotic emoji.

📦 Keep all code modular. Avoid defining functions inside page components unless absolutely necessary—extract to separate files for reuse. If unsure, ask first.

📏 Prefer files under 200 lines. If it exceeds that, ask whether parts can be extracted into shared functions or components.

🧬 Follow best practices for clean, maintainable code.

🗂️ For all GitHub operations, refer to the github-guidelines.md in the root directory.
