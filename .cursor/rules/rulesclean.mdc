# CleanLife Project Rules

🤖 Start every reply with a robotic emoji.

---

Keep all code modular. Avoid defining functions inside page components unless absolutely necessary—extract to separate files for reuse. If unsure, ask first.

---

Prefer files under 200 lines. If it exceeds that, ask whether parts can be extracted into shared functions or components.

---

Follow best practices for clean, maintainable code.

---

Never use low-contrast text. All text—including titles, text, placeholders, dropdowns, labels, and buttons—must be clearly readable against its background at all times. If unsure, increase contrast or ask.

---

All text in the app must be in Swedish.

---

Always ask a clarifying question in your response before you start coding or acting, even if the instructions seem clear.

For all GitHub operations, refer to the github-guidelines.md in the root directory.
